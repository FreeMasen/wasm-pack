# Changelog

## üåü 0.4.0

This release has a ton of awesome things in it, but the best thing is that
all of this awesome work is brought to you by a **new** contributor to
`wasm-pack`. Welcome ya'll! we're so glad to have you!

### ‚ú® Features

- #### üéè New Flags

  - **`--skip-build` flag for the init command - [kohensu], [pull/151]**

    Sometimes you want to run some of the shorter meta-data steps that
    `wasm-pack init` does for you without all the longer build steps. Now
    you can! Additionally, this PR was a fantastic refactor that allows even
    more custom build configurations will be simple to implement!

  - **`--debug` flag for the init command - [clanehin], [pull/127]**

    Find yourself needing to compile your Rust in `development` mode? You can now
    pass the `--debug` flag to do so! Thanks so much to [clanehin] for filing 
    [issue/126] for this feature... and then implementing it!

- #### ‚úÖ New Checks

  - **ensure you have `cdylib` crate type - [kendromelon], [pull/150]**

    One of the biggest mistakes we've seen beginners make is forgetting to declare
    the `cdylib` crate type in their `Cargo.toml` before running `wasm-pack init`.
    This PR fixes that, and comes from someone who ran into this exact issue learning
    about `wasm-pack` at [JSConfEU]! Love when it works out like this.

  - **ensure you have declared wasm-bindgen as a dep - [robertohuertasm], [pull/162]**

    Another easy mistake to make is to forget to declare `wasm-bindgen` as a
    dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. Now `wasm-pack` will check and make sure you
    have it set before doing a bunch of long build steps :)

### ü§ï Fixes

- **fixed broken progress bar spinner - [migerh], [pull/164]**

  Oh no! We broke the progress bar spinner in version 0.3.0. Thankfully, it's
  fixed now- with a thoughtful refactor that also makes the underlying code
  sounder overall.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

- **wasm category for crates.io discovery- [TomasHubelbauer], [pull/149]**

  [crates.io] has [categories] to help folks discover crates, be we weren't
  leveraging it! Now- if you explore the [`wasm` category] on [crates.io]
  you'll see `wasm-pack`!

  Congrats friends! We like what you do.

### üìñ Documentation

- **cleaned up the README - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/155]**

  Our `README` was struggling with a common problem- doing too much at once.
  More specifically, it wasn't clear who the audience was, contributers or 
  end users? We've cleaned up our README and created a document specifically
  to help contributors get up and running.

## üå† 0.3.1

Babby's first point release! Are we a real project now?

### ü§ï Fixes 

- **fixed `init` `Is a Directory` error - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/139]**

  Our new logging feature accidentally introduced a regression into 0.3.0. When
  calling `wasm-pack init`, if a directory was not passed, a user would receive
  a "Is a Directory" Error. Sorry about that! Thanks to [jbolila] for filing 
  [issue/136]!

- **typescript files were not included in published package - [danreeves], [pull/138]**

  Generating Typescript type files by default was a pretty rad feature in
  0.3.0 but we accidentally forgot to ensure they were included in the 
  published package. Thanks so much to [danreeves] for catching this issue 
  and fixing it for us!

## üí´ 0.3.0

### ‚ú® Features

- **Logging - [mgattozzi], [pull/134]**

  Up until now, we've forced folks to rely on emoji-jammed console output to debug
  errors. While emojis are fun, this is often not the most pleasant experience. Now
  we'll generate a `wasm-pack.log` file if `wasm-pack` errors on you, and you can
  customize the log verbosity using the (previously unimplemented) verbosity flag.

[pull/134]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/134

- **`--target` flag - [djfarly], [pull/132]**

  `wasm-bindgen-cli` is able to generate a JS module wrapper for generated wasm files
  for both ES6 modules and CommonJS. Up until now, we only used wasm-bindgen's default
  behavior, ES6 modules. You can now pass a `--target` flag with either `nodejs` or 
  `browser` to generate the type of module you want to use. Defaults to `browser` if not
  passed.

[pull/132]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/132

- **human readable panics - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/118]**

  Panics aren't always the most friendly situation ever. While we never want to panic on ya,
  if we do- we'll do it in a way that's a little more readable now.

[pull/118]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/118

- **typescript support by default - [kwonoj], [pull/109]**

  `wasm-bindgen` now generates typescript type files by default. To suppress generating
  the type file you can pass the `--no-typescript` flag. The type file is useful for more
  than just typescript folks- many IDEs use it for completion!

[kwonoj]: https://github.com/kwonoj
[pull/109]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/109

- **wrap `npm login` command - [djfarly], [pull/100]**

  In order to publish a package to npm, you need to be logged in. You can now use
  `wasm-pack login` to login to the npm (or any other) registry.

[pull/100]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/100

- **exit early on failure - [mgattozzi], [pull/90]**

  Until now, `wasm-pack` would continue to run tasks, even if a task failed. Now- if something
  fails, we'll exit so you don't have to wait to fix the error.

[pull/90]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/90

### ü§ï Fixes

- **force install wasm-bindgen - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/133]**

  Using an out of date version of `wasm-bindgen` can run you into a bunch of trouble. This
  very small change should fix the large number of bug reports we received from users using
  an out of date `wasm-bindgen-cli` by force installing `wasm-bindgen-cli` to ensure the user
  always has the latest version. We don't expect this to be a forever solution (it's a bit
  slow!) but it should help those who are getting started have a less rough time.

[pull/133]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/133

- **fix CI release builds - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/135]**

  This was not working! But now it is! You can always use `cargo install` to install
  wasm-pack, but now you can find pre-built Linux and Mac binaries in the [Releases]
  tab of our GitHub repo.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance 

- **remove `quicli` dependency - [mgattozzi], [pull/131]**

  While `quicli` is a great way to get started writing a CLI app in Rust- it's not meant for 
  large, mature applications. Now that `wasm-pack` is bigger and has many active users, we've
  removed this dependency to unblock further development on the tool.

[pull/131]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/131

- **update rustfmt CI test - [djfarly], [pull/128]**

  Since 0.2.0 how one should call `rustfmt` changed! We've kept it up to date so we can continue
  to maintain conventional style in the codebase.

[pull/128]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/128

- **custom module for errors - [mgattozzi], [pull/120]**

  Thanks to the `failure` crate, we've been playing fast and loose with errors for a bit. We're
  finally getting serious about error handling - by organizing all of our specific errors in a
  specific module. This will make it easier to communicate these errors out and handle new error
  cases from future features.

[pull/120]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/120

### üìñ Documentation

Special thanks to [data-pup] who continues to be our documentation champion! In case you missed it,
check out the guides in the [docs directory!](docs)!

## üåå 0.2.0

This release focuses on filling out all commands and improving stderr/out
handling for improved user experience!

### ‚ú® Features

- **`pack` and `publish` - [jamiebuilds], [pull/67]**
  You can now run `wasm-pack pack` to generate a tarball of your generated package,
  as well as run `wasm-pack publish` to publish your package to the npm registry.
  Both commands require that you have npm installed, and the `publish` command requires
  that you be logged in to the npm client. We're working on wrapping the `npm login`
  command so that you can also login directly from `wasm-pack`, see [pull/100] for more
  details.

- **`package.json` is pretty printed now - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  Previously, `package.json` was not very human readable. Now it is pretty printed!

- **`collaborators` - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  `wasm-pack` now will fill out the `collaborators` field in your `package.json` for
  you based on your `Cargo.toml` `authors` data. For more discussion on how we decided
  on this v.s. other types of `author` fields in `package.json`, see [issues/2].
